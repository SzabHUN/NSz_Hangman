    NOTE:

		-the different speed may be the cause of the phone having

        - the current placeholder word that needs to be guessed is "HANGMAN"
        - there is no exit if all the lives had been lost,
            so it will definitely crash if more than 7 wrong answers are given
        - TODO: make an exit and a lock on the buttons when all lives are lost --------------- Done.

- Edited space size in activity_main.xml
- Updated activity_opener.xml background image (no static version number)

    NOTE:

        - Try random selection from the string array.



2019.06.10. 16:20 - SzabHUN

- Added the ability to read from the words.xml file
    - It also should be dynamic so if there would be more words added,
        the program SHOULD run fine...



2019.06.10. 19:42 - Sprotni

- Added new Activity "MenuActivity" coming soon...

    NOTE:

        - I'll continue this later ...



2019.06.10. 22:17 - SzabHUN

- Added a few more words to the pile [now there is a total of 165]
    ... I may come back to this later... to add a FEW more.... (end goal 500)
- Added a Clear Screen button that resets the screen, but does not change the actual word
- Added a newWord function to generate a new word without re-opening the application

        - It usually skips 175 frames when a new word is declared & 30-70 frames
            when a button is pressed
        - The log now shows the current selected word as well
		- PS: I looked it up and Krita CAN use photoshop brushes,
		    so I can share it with our designer



2019.06.11. 07:21 - SzabHUN

- Added a TON of new words to the words.xml file and created a hungarian version of it
    with like 1/5 of the words there

	NOTE:

		- it could be easier to find HUN. words that are the max length of 8...



2019.06.11. 12:23 - SzabHUN

- Added a new class, called ResetAll, without breaking the whole application... huraaay...

    NOTE:

        - It made next to no difference in the speed of the app, and also made a backup copy,
            just in case...
		- I made multiple copies of the code before changing it:
			- 1 is next to the now edited code
			- 1 is in a backup folder that contains the whole app as well
			- 1 is on my main PC

		- TODO: IDLE ANIMATION ------------------------------------------------------------ On Hold.
        - TODO: find a way to be useful once again... o_o ----------------------- I think its done?!



2019.06.12. 21:43 - Sprotni

- Changed Menu screen fix portrait

        NOTE:

         - Some devices have very fast application ...



2019.06.13. 23:01 - SzabHUN

- About to start something that will make the program not work as it is doing it now
    - I hate myself...  (still...)
    - Lost the will to exist...  (again...)

        NOTE:

            - this will be catastrophic if it won't work....

        Update:
            2019.06.14 00:20
                - successful pair of UI elments in ImageView
                - failure pair in UI elements in Buttons
                    - fixed @ 00:35 - Reason: stack overflow, by one...



2019.06.14. 00:40 - SzabHUN

- Regained the wil to exist...  (again...)
- Optimised the code, it runs MUCH faster, still chugs at certain points...
    - like after MarkingTheSpaceForTheWord() ended

    NOTE:

        - The comments of the codefrom before can ALL be deleted,
            along with the "public void reset" function
        - TODO: add animation on the menu when texture is received ------------------------ On Hold.



2019.06.14. 16:43 - Sprotni

- Using Java instead of XML ... View the MenuActivity.java file.
- I started in GameActivity.java, but I couldn't finish it ... keep thinking or continue.

    NOTE:

        - Maybe the app would be faster.



2019.06.15. 00:40 - SzabHUN

- Almost broke EVERYTHING ... as usual...
- Made the GameActivity.java too fast, things finished in the wrong order,
    and that caused the buttons to not get their ImageResources... Sad...
    - I added 4 seconds of delay so this won't happen until we find a way to fix it

    NOTE:

        - TODO: tweak/remove that 4 second delay and/or fix the code ------------------------- Done.
        - TODO: mark all " TODO: " lines accordingly ----------------------------------------- Done.



2019.06.17. 23:25 - SzabHUN

- Ran out of ideas
- Fixed the resetting order

    NOTE:

        - I have no idea about what or how to do next...
        - TODO: use less " TODO: " -s in the notes... ---------------------------------In Progress!?



2019.06.19. 12:09 - SzabHUN

- Tried to add PlaySound when a button is pressed - something went wrong and it crashes the program
- Added a SoundFile for the SoundEffect for the ButtonPress action, in GameActivity.java

    NOTE:

    - I left it broken so that I can later I can further suffer from the inconsistency of AS........
    . I gadly accept help in that front, btw



2019.06.24. 18:33 - SzabHUN

- Updated the version number................. yeah.... progress..... yeeey......

    NOTE:
        -No but really nothing else happened....


2019.06.24 19:38 - SzabHUN

- Added three different JAVA classes to call in when a button is pressed
    the idea is:
                 there would be 3 classes and when the user activates multiple buttons,
                 then it will lock itself down (the class) and run the check with the given
                 button prompt, after that is done, it will unlock itself
                 so that it may accept another input from he user

                 since there is 3 different ones, while one is working,
                 the others are still available to do the same task that the 1st one does.

                 example:

                 -5 rapid inputs from the user;
                 -the first button pressed will use the first available class
                 -since the forst one is now locked, it will go for the next one, and so on...
                 -now there are no class that is able to be used in the current point in time
                 -since it couldn't process the button press, it will stay in an infinite loop
                    until it will be able to run itself




2019. 06. 28 09:34 - Sprotni

- Whaaao-Whaaooo.... talk me Discord... your code complicated. :D
- Tested app ... slow.... Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra
- I'll continue my code soon...
- Please use more comments to your code ...
- And if not every button would don't be a separate void?
- Let's try this again ...
- I think we should make a copy of this project and redesign the entire GameActivity.
- If you think this is a good idea, write to me!

    NOTE:



2019.06.28. 12:14 - SzabHUN

- Removed 26 public voids for each of the buttons
- Added 1 single public void for all  the buttons

    NOTE:

        - App still runs at the same speed, but now it won't get worse, and for that matter better
            when the app is running



2019.07.09. 16:33 - SzabHUN

- Added stuff to the Activity_About.xml
- Forgot to add the background so it has to be re-designed - redone.

    NOTE:

        - Obvious placeholders are obvious...


2019.07.11. 20:39 - SzabHUN

- Added basic visuals to Activity_Options.xml

    NOTE:

        - Waiting on further feedback to continue...
        - Obvious placeholders are still obvious...


2019.07.12. 04:18 - SzabHUN

- Added a primitive version of the language changer, that currently only effects the OptionsActivity
- Added a copy of strings.xml, strings_hu.xml to the values folder.


    NOTE:

        - The AS throws a tantrum whenever there are duplicates of the same string variable names
            in the same project, even in multiple string.xml files so there should be a "hu_" prefix
            before each string variable name in the strings_hu.xml file

        - Obvious placeholders are still obvious.... we may want to hire a designer or something....

2019.07.17. 01:28 - SzabHUN

- Making the idea a possibility, requires further work, TODO:this-------------------Still-On-The-Way

    NOTE:

2019.07.27. 16:55 - SzabHUN

-Added the Hungarian version of the GameActivity.java & activity_main.xml
-further Resources are still required, like the Hungarian letters AND
                                          TODO: finish the about screen,------------------On-The-Way
                                          TODO: need feedback on what pictures to use in the credits
                                           (and if I will be the one doing the design or not...)

    NOTE:

        -looks good, but haven't tested it, because we still need to implement that universal var...
         (there is no way to get to it in the first place,
         I'm waiting until that LNG var will be functional {I gave up on that} )

2019.08.05. 20:39 - Sprotni

- Added version code and version name to AboutActivity.java and activity_about.xml

    NOTE:

        - The letters that appear should be like this ... GameActivity...No Images No Problems...
        - I have a good idea ...
